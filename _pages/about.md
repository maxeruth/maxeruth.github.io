Hello! 

I am a 6th year PhD student in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I am interested in problems that, broadly, involve dynamical systems, numerical analysis, and applications to physical systems. My current work specifically involves analyzing problems in with symplectic maps arising in plasma physics. 

Previous to this, my candidacy exam was on a problem of nonlinear vibrations in piezoelectric materials. I have also worked on parallel computations of the tensor train decomposition.
